  <tr>
    <td> The way that i learnt was I read the instructions on the side of the page very carefully so that I made sure that I understood it very well and that i wouldn't just copy it directly on to the code page, if i didn't understand something i would not ask the teacher straight away i would look at it again and try to figure it out on my own, if that didn’t work then i would ask the person next to me before going to the teacher fist but i would not cheat and skip the exercise.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that i though limited my learning wa the fact that in the IT lessons I won't spend the whole hour on the code academy instead i might go on something else or i might have a conversation with someone, this means that I will not get as much work done and it won't be as high quality because i won’t be very focused so i can't read the instructions well at all.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time i will make sure that i spend the entire time working on my code academy and 0 time messing around with other things such as talking to others, this is make sure that i will be very focused at i will work good and make it correct and it will work with no errors at all but i can't do that if i mess around but that i why i wont mess around.</td>
