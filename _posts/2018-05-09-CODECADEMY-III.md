    <td>What limited my learning was I was talking to the people around me to much and so I wasn't fully concentrating on my work so i couldn't do as much work in the lesson.

    <td>Next time I wonâ€™t talk to the people around me as much so I can focus more on my work and not get distracted as much so I can get more work done in the lesson.</td>
