  <tr>
    <td>I learn by first looking at the instructions on the side of the page and then i followed the instructions that are there and i also applied my own knowledge to the code as well, if i was stuck i wouldn't just go to the teacher straight away I would ask the person next to me first so i can see what they are doing and apply it to my own work if that doesn't work i will ask someone else in the class for help before going to the teacher as a last resort if i still can't figure it out.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning this time is that i was a bit too focused  on talking to the person sitting next to me so I was not concentrating on my work on code academy as much as could have been had i not been talking to the person next to me this also affects the quality of my work as well because as i wasn't focused i couldn't produce as good work as i could produced if i was focused more on my work.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time i will make sure that I don't talk to the person next to me as much as i do now and i will only talk if i am talking about the work so i will talk if i am stuck and if i want to know how my partner does the work and if i can use that strategy to my own work, the reason for this if that if i talk less i will focus more on my work and therefore i can not only do more work but it will be better quality and i will make less mistakes because i will be able to spot them more easily because I will be more focused.</td>
