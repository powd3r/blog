    <td>I learnt by looking at the instructions and following them i would read them very carefully so that i would not miss anything on the instructions at the side of the page provided by code academy to make the learning easier and it works very well i follow them every lesson for most of the activities not all of them some i get on my own but for the majority need to follow the instructions they are good instructions and work well and improve my learning.</td>

    <td>Talking to the person next to me, this does not help with my learning not at all it distracts me and makes me talk about something else not relevant to the work so i can't do good work and i want  to do good work because i learn more that if i talk i won't do good way work but i don't complete it and will have to do work at home and at home i won't do it as well.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Don't talk because i can't do good work  if i talk and  i want  to do good work because i learn more and i am only here to learn loads and lots about how to code on python so far i have learnt lots and lots but if i talk i can't learn lots and it won't be worth it so what i will do next lesson is i will make sure that i wont talk as much to the person next to me so that i will concentrate more and do the work that i need to do.</td>
