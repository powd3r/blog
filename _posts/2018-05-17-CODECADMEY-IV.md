  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by first reading the instructions on the side of the code and then I made sure I understood it before I applied it to the code and after I did that I checked it before clicking "run". When I was stuck I persevered and didn't just ask for help straight away, instead i checked through my code line by line and make sure that i didn't make any errors and if that didn't work i would ask the person next to me before going to the teacher and than after anything I would ask the teacher for help with the task - I wouldn't use the “solution” button.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning is that i was not 100 % focused on my work because I was talking to the people around me so I couldn’t focus on the work properly so I couldn’t get as much done than if I was 100% focused, this meant that I didn’t learn as much and definitely didn’t get as much out of the lesson as I could of done.

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What I will change next time is that I will make sure that i am 100% focused on my work by trying not to get distracted by anything such as the people around me talking or talking to others this way I will be more focused and get a lot more work done and I will understand it better because i will be able to focus more on the instructions and what they tell me to do, this will enable me to get through it a lot faster and make a lot less errors that i would of done i was talking to others or being distracted by other people or something similar.</td>
