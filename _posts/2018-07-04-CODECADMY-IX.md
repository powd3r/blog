    <td>I learnt by following the instructions on the side of the page, and making sure that I read the instructions carefully for every exercise that i do and i will have to remember old skills and if i am stuck i can ask the person next to me, when i'm at home doing the work i will go online and see how to do it there if I am stuck while doing the work, I don't use the solution button.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was talking to the person next to me while I am doing my work this distracts me from my work on codecademy and I will often make mistakes and not complete it properly and the mistakes will be simple avoidable things like making a typo and misspelling words and not including things like a colon on the end of a line, these are the things that break my code and I will often not realise that i missed a letter or a colon on my work and it will waste time when I could be doing some of the work instead.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will make sure that I am not talking to the person next to me so I can focus on my work and not make stupid errors that I can avoid if I just focus a little bit more on my work and not get distracted and i can focus more on my work and produce code that will work and I can continue to the next exercise.   </td>
