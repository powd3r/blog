  <tr>
    <td>The way I learnt was I looked at the side and read what I had to do for that exercise and then I applied my skills and completed the task, if I  was stuck then I would first read the hint that they give on the side to see if it joggs my memory and if it doesn't then I will go and ask the person next to me, if he doesn't know then I will ask the teacher, I won't use the solution button though.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was definitely talking to the person next to me a lot and also going on to my blog page because that took a lot of time up, this limited my learning because I was not very focused on my work so I can’t really do it as well as I could do it and the things that I got distracted by don’t really help my learning so I don't learn as much in the lesson as I could do.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try to only talk to the person next to me when I actually need help with the work on code accademy so that i can get on with my work a lot better and get a lot done so i learn more in the lesson, I also won’t spend as much time getting my blog up and just get it up once at the start so that the teacher can check it, i won’t mess around on it and try to change things on it rather i will do that at lunchtime in the it room.</td>
