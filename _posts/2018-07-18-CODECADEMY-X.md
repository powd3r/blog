    <td>I learnt by following the instructions on the side of the page and copying it on to my code i make sure that i check it first for any mistakes and typos and other mistakes such as spelling mistakes.</td>

    <td>In the lesson I talk to the person next to me too much and it distracts me from doing my work and when i do this i make more mistakes and my code won't work properly and i won't understand it as well.</td>

    <td>Next time i will not talk to my partner as much and i will focus more on my work and yet more done in the lesson so i don't have to work at home, and the work that i do won't have as many mistakes or typos as if i had done if i hadnâ€™t talked to my partner during the lesson.</td>
